# S3PrivateCloud
S3 Private Cloud manager.  A vendor-agnostic, cross-platform S3 client built with Flet/Python. Connect to AWS, MinIO, or any S3 provider with zero tracking and full data sovereignty.
Your Data, Your Rules. A lightweight, cross-platform client designed for complete independence and total control over your digital assets.

Unlike proprietary cloud apps that lock you into a single ecosystem, S3 Freedom Manager is a vendor-agnostic tool built to work with any S3-compatible storage provider. Whether you use enterprise giants like AWS, local providers like Cloud.ru/Yandex, or self-hosted solutions like MinIO on your own home server — this app gives you a unified, secure interface to manage your files.

🛡️ Key Philosophies
🚫 No Vendor Lock-In: Switch providers instantly without changing your workflow. Your data is not tied to this app; we simply provide the window to view it.

🔒 Zero-Knowledge Privacy: We don't run a backend server. Your Access Keys and Secret Keys are stored locally on your device using secure client storage. No middleman sees your credentials.

🏠 Self-Hosted Ready: Perfect for privacy enthusiasts running private clouds (NAS/MinIO). Keep your data physically within your control while enjoying a modern mobile/desktop UI.

⚡ Direct Connection: All file transfers happen directly between your device and your storage bucket. No proxy servers, no throttling, no hidden data harvesting.

Take back control of your cloud storage.
